							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am from Chicago, Illinois. I graduated high school from St. Ignatius College Prep (pictured). I am studying Special Education here at the university. Once I get into the field I would like to look into coaching, either football or rugby.</p>

							<h2>Rugby Career</h2>
							<p>I started playing rugby back in high school and then decided to continue my journey into college. In high school, I played at the varsity level all four years. That encouraged me enough to continue that sport into college, here on the university's club team. I played two full seasons before having to retire.</p>

							<h2>Football Career</h2>
							<p>I played little football in grade school, only 6th and 7th grade, but was able to continue my football career once getting to high school. I played all four years of high school, starting at the varsity level for three years. Received a couple offers from smaller colleges, but I knew that was not what I wanted to play.</p>

								<h2>Why Education?</h2>
								<p>I chose Special Education as my major because of the fact that I have been around educators my whole life. Both my parents being teachers made me want to be a teacher as well. Another thing that played into my choice of Special Education and not just Mathematics or Social Studies was my football coach from freshman year of high school. He was a Special Education teacher and I grew really close to his son and him throughout my high school career.</p>

									<h2>My Website</h2>
									<p>I put this website together over the Thanksgiving weekend finishing on Monday, before class. In recall of doing the project, it was not too much of a challenge and I felt Professor Wu set us up very well to complete it. Even working through the coding of the website was not as bad as I had imagined it would be. I am pleased with how it turned out and any comments would be received appreciatively.</p>
